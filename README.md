## Project summary.

### Inspiration

The inspiration behind "RecoverEase" stems from the urgent need to address the increasingly frequent and severe climate-related disasters facing communities around the world, particularly in Africa. Witnessing the devastating impacts of floods, storms, and droughts, we recognized the critical importance of efficient and effective disaster recovery and reconstruction efforts in building resilience and safeguarding livelihoods.

The idea for RecoverEase was born out of a desire to leverage technology and innovation to streamline and enhance these vital processes. Inspired by the resilience and strength of communities coming together in the face of adversity, we sought to create a solution that empowers stakeholders with the tools they need to respond rapidly, coordinate effectively, and rebuild sustainably in the aftermath of disasters.

### How our tech solution can help

RecoverEase provides a comprehensive software platform designed to facilitate damage assessment, resource allocation, and coordination among government agencies, NGOs, and humanitarian organizations. By leveraging technology to automate and streamline these critical processes, RecoverEase aims to expedite the recovery process and enhance resilience to future climate hazards.

### Our idea

RecoverEase offers a user-friendly interface for conducting damage assessments, allowing users to upload imagery and input data to assess the extent and severity of the damage. The platform then analyzes this data to identify damaged infrastructure and prioritize resource allocation based on real-time needs.

## Technology Implementation.

The project primarily utilized React for front-end development. The project also levarages tools like TialwindCSS for utility based styling.
